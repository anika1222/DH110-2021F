# Assignment 02: Pilot Usability Testing - Anika Murthy, DH 110

## Introduction: Arizona Department of Health Services
The Arizona Department of Health Services promotes and protects the health of Arizona's children, adults, and seniors. Through the combiantion of public health + policy, science, direct care, and leadership, this government branch strives to set the precedent to for personal and community-wide healthcare. Through their comprehensive website, Arizonans can access information and resources pertaining to nearly every healthcare-related topic based on their respective age groups/demographics. In Assignment #1, I conducted a heurestic evaluation of this site and weighted its application of human-centered design; in this assignment, I will be using my findings from the heurestic evalution to perform a usability test of the website based on the site's three (3) weakest heurestics that I previously evaluated. While the usability testing conducted in this assignemnt will pertain to these three heurestics, it is holistically centered around the overall navigation of the site/user journey, as this posed a usability problem in and of itself in the prior assessment.

Heuristic Being Tested | Usability Problem  | Task Scenario  |
:--- | :--- | :--- |
User control and freedom  | "Find What You're Looking For" drop-down  menu does not include a "Go" or "Confirm" button, immediately taking users to a new page for a category that they might not have intentionally selected  | Find CPR-related information for volunteers
Recognition rather than recall  | Many ways to get to a specific position, making it difficult for a user to go back or understand how they got to a certain point of their journey | Acces oral health resources for adults/seniors by two (2) different manners |
Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors | Broken links display a standard error message but do not offer redirection nor help to the user  | Efficiently seek COVID-19 info for Spanish-speakers through a broken link  |
