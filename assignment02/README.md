# Assignment 02: Pilot Usability Testing - Anika Murthy, DH 110

## Introduction: Arizona Department of Health Services
The Arizona Department of Health Services promotes and protects the health of Arizona's children, adults, and seniors. Through the combiantion of public health + policy, science, direct care, and leadership, this government branch strives to set the precedent to for personal and community-wide healthcare. Through their comprehensive website, Arizonans can access information and resources pertaining to nearly every healthcare-related topic based on their respective age groups/demographics. In Assignment #1, I conducted a heurestic evaluation of this site and weighted its application of human-centered design; in this assignment, I will be using my findings from the heurestic evalution to perform a usability test of the website based on the site's three (3) weakest heurestics that I previously evaluated. While the usability testing conducted in this assignemnt will pertain to these three heurestics, it is holistically centered around the overall navigation of the site/user journey, as this posed a usability problem in and of itself in the prior assessment.

Heuristic Being Tested | Usability Problem  | Task Scenario  |
:--- | :--- | :--- |
User control and freedom  | "Find What You're Looking For" drop-down  menu does not include a "Go" or "Confirm" button, immediately taking users to a new page for a category that they might not have intentionally selected  | Find CPR-related information for volunteers
Recognition rather than recall  | Many ways to get to a specific position, making it difficult for a user to go back or understand how they got to a certain point of their journey | Acces oral health resources for adults/seniors by two (2) different manners |
Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors | Broken links display a standard error message but do not offer redirection nor help to the user  | Efficiently seek COVID-19 info for Spanish-speakers through a broken link  |

## Purpose of Usability Testing
A usability test (UT) is performed to assess and improve the usability (effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction) of a product or experience through the collection of empirical data and observation of representative end users. In this case, I will be utilizing UT in order to examine usability problems from my previous heurestic evalution. While the heurestic evaluation was pivotal to the identification of these aforementioned usability problems, a UT is the most comprehensive and accurate manner to understand the participant/user's thoughts and reactions while interacting with the product. By the design of my UT, I hope to observe the behaviors of my survey's participant, specifically when they encounter any usability problems. 

## Methodology
The pilot usability test took place in my apartment in Los Angeles, CA. The participant was a 20-year old male who utilized a laptop to complete the usability test. 

**Usability Test Structure:**
* Introduction
* Informed Consent
* Background Questions
* Pre-Test Questions
* Task Scenarios 
* Post-Test Questionnaire
* System Usability Scale (SUS)
* Product Satisfaction Card
* Demographics

This test was conducted and documented via Zoom – the participant screen-recorded his navigation through the survey while simultaneously recording himself and his discourse.

## Reflection
While this UT went generally smooth and I was able to receive information that was vital to my intial heurestic evaluation, there were definitely some shortcomings that may have reduced the overall efficiency of the test. After conducting this test, I have better understood many aspects of a user experience, most importantly, that is it very subjective to each user, meaning usability issues that may have been prominent to me, could easily be overlooked by a user with a unique set of life and web-navigation experiences. 

Throughout the entire process, I had an urge to guide the participant through the site as I possessed more knowledge on how to navigate it. This urge persisted through the duration of the UT and was especially frustrating when the participant encountered the broken link. While I had looped around this usability flaw many times, the participant had no and observing the way he encountered and reacted to this issue was especially helpful to my research. Watching a first-time user navigate their journey through the AZDHS site shed light on many usability issues that I had either a) overlooked or b) not recognized – this allowed me to recognize the importance of having multiple pairs of eyes interact with a product.

Although the participant completed this test in the same space as me, I chose to remain hands-off and urged them to build their own experience and set of interactions to avoid bias or ingenuinity throughout this process. While it was difficult to not assist the participant, I uncovered a lot of information about the usability of the AZDHS site through my participant's holistic and technical review of it. I appreciated the sincere effort the participant put into the conduction of this UT – he actively and verbally expressed his thought processes as well as his general impressions of the site's usability; observing a first-time user's reaction to various facets of the site aided with my understanding of usability in general.
