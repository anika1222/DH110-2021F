# Assignment 02: Pilot Usability Testing - Anika Murthy, DH 110

## Introduction: Arizona Department of Health Services
The Arizona Department of Health Services promotes and protects the health of Arizona's children, adults, and seniors. Through the combiantion of public health + policy, science, direct care, and leadership, this government branch strives to set the precedent to for personal and community-wide healthcare. Through their comprehensive website, Arizonans can access information and resources pertaining to nearly every healthcare-related topic based on their respective age groups/demographics. In Assignment #1, I conducted a heurestic evaluation of this site and weighted its application of human-centered design; in this assignment, I will be using my findings from the heurestic evalution to perform a usability test of the website based on the site's three (3) weakest heurestics that I previously evaluated. While the usability testing conducted in this assignemnt will pertain to these three heurestics, it is holistically centered around the overall navigation of the site/user journey, as this posed a usability problem in and of itself in the prior assessment.

Heuristic Being Tested | Usability Problem  | Task Scenario  |
:--- | :--- | :--- |
User control and freedom  | "Find What You're Looking For" drop-down  menu does not include a "Go" or "Confirm" button, immediately taking users to a new page for a category that they might not have intentionally selected  | Find CPR-related information for volunteers
Recognition rather than recall  | Many ways to get to a specific position, making it difficult for a user to go back or understand how they got to a certain point of their journey | Acces oral health resources for adults/seniors by two (2) different manners |
Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors | Broken links display a standard error message but do not offer redirection nor help to the user  | Efficiently seek COVID-19 info for Spanish-speakers through a broken link  |

## Purpose of Usability Testing
A usability test (UT) is performed to assess and improve the usability (effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction) of a product or experience through the collection of empirical data and observation of representative end users. In this case, I will be utilizing UT in order to examine usability problems from my previous heurestic evalution. While the heurestic evaluation was pivotal to the identification of these aforementioned usability problems, a UT is the most comprehensive and accurate manner to understand the participant/user's thoughts and reactions while interacting with the product. By the design of my UT, I hope to observe the behaviors of my survey's participant, specifically when they encounter any usability problems. 

## Methodology
The pilot usability test took place in my apartment in Los Angeles, CA. The participant was a 20-year old male who utilized a laptop to complete the usability test. 

**Usability Test Structure:**
* Introduction
* Informed Consent
* Background Questions
* Pre-Test Questions
* Task Scenarios 
* Post-Test Questionnaire
* System Usability Scale (SUS)
* Product Satisfaction Card
* Demographics

This test was conducted and documented via Zoom â€“ the participant screen-recorded his navigation through the survey while simultaneously recording himself and his discourse.
