# DH 110 Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry

## Preface

### Step 1: Specify the main design challenge

**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**
> For this project, I centered my research around the accessibility to art venues in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area, specifically focusing on marginalized groups. This project will support users and citizens of Los Angeles in accessing/viewing art at public museums and venues free of charge, making art a communal and inclusive commodity.

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
> This activity fulfills the user's basic need for arts education, something that is not traditionally available to marginalized groups, but is vital to any user's understanding of Los Angeles' rich cultural history. Obtaining a comprehensive arts education allows for people to respect their city more and attain higher levels of happiness in said city. 

**What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
>Current solutions to satisfy this need for creating an inclusive arts culture in Los Angeles are sparse, but still exist. An example would be museums such as LACMA allowing free admission, which promotes the attendance of people from all avenues of Los Angeles, as well as smaller museums and art centers in Los Angeles hosting events and activity fairs to offer arts immersion to all peoples of LA. 

**What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
>Certain limitations for an arts education include: 1) Only getting information about arts education centers/venues through word-of-mouth, information that is not documentable or trackable, making it a highly unreliable source 2) Only hosting information about arts education centers on each center's respective website – this makes the findability of other art centers highly difficult, there should be one (1) mastersite to host the entirety of these resources.

### Step 2: Identify target users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
>Demographic: adult citizens of Los Angeles, underrepresented minorities, marginalized groups, students, researchers

>Preferences: Users have the desire and mobility to get around the city, users are proactive about obtaining an arts education and will put in the time to acquire the resources that they need

>Expertise: Users do not need any particular level of expertise to use this platform/application

**In what context (where, why) would the users do that activity?**
>A user would mainly attempt to gather an arts education when they are trying to enrich themselves on Los Angeles culture. The reason for wanting to obtain an arts education is subjective, but potential motives could include: 1) Being an underrepresented minority and wanting to understand the historical significance of your culture throughout the development of Los Angeles 2) Being a student researcher and wanting to conduct anthropological studies of the city 3) Needing to view historically significant artworks displayed exclusively in LA out of personal interest or to fulfill student coursework. Typically, someone with an understanding of the necessity of an arts education would be 18 years and older, and would probably seek such resources from the perspective of a student. 

**What would the users do to complete that activity?**
>To complete this activity, users would conduct thorough research on artworks of choice, visit local museums and art centers, and speak with professionals around them (museum curators, historians, local artists, anthropologists, etc) to gather a holistic understanding of the humanities in a metropolitan city. While the users would have many available manners by which to gather this information, the primary one would be visiting art centers and experiencing works first-hand.

### Step 3: Pick observation method(s)

* I decided to use a hybrid of two methods to conduct my research: participatory observation and interview.
  * For participatory observation I observed how my participant gathered information about arts education centers online.
  * For the interview, I asked my participant some questions about her view on the accesibility of the arts in LA and her preffered methods (online, word-of-mouth, visiting art centers, etc) of seeking this arts education as a minority himself.
* Both of these observations were conducted in person in Westwood, Los Angeles, California. 
* I used a webcam to video record both the interview and participatory observation.

### Noteworthy insights from the interview:

**:one: How often the user hears about issues with art accessibility and its relation to taking action (3:56)**
> "That’s like a big thing – I always hear about that [art education/accessibility], even in like middle school, high school – I always heard about that. It’s super big to give an arts education; my middle school was an arts magnet, so that was something that was always brought up. Especially with music, we were always told we were super lucky to have that."

**:two: How the user compares the experience of visiting small vs. large museums (6:57)**
> "I think large art museums help you, like, get your step into art – it’s not as intimidating, cause with small art museums there may be a more concentrated crowd, so you might feel like you don’t understand certain things, so I think the benefit in small art is like, there’s more nuances maybe and stuff like that, especially for people who are really interested in art, but then, in a large museum, it’s like taking that first step."

**:three: How the user weighs the importance of an arts education in LA versus other social issues (7:20)**
> "I think the arts are super important, before I say anything – it’s like one of the most important things to have in a well-rounded education; in LA, there’s a lot of problems going on, so I don’t know how much I feel that it should be important on the undergrad/grad level – I think it should be really important in the middle school/high school level, because from there students can take it wherever they want. But I think it should be important at that level, but there’s like so many important things, issues that go on in LA, and so I think this would be best-prioritized at that time."

## Reflection

I enjoyed the contextual inquiry process because of the freedom it gave me to make observations and learn from other users with neither me nor them being inhibited by any kind of preconceptions, like the user/participant may have been in the more formal Usability Test. I found the additional questions, not only about the product, but about the user’s background and personal conceptions of the space/community I am exploring to be particularly interesting. Several of the points made by the participant aligned with ideas I had already had regarding new features for the product, so it was great to see this unbiased validation, since this participant was not at all informed about my ideas. I appreciated the participant’s openness and addition of many details into their descriptions and statements — this interview allowed me to acquire a pretty clear idea of one kind of user persona. However, I am not sure if I did every component of this user interview correctly as I did pose some guiding questions/statements to the participant without following as strict of guidelines as outlined in the example script. I think what would be helpful to me would be to be a participant in a study myself and see how other more experienced researchers conduct such interviews.
