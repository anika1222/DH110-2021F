# DH 110 Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry

## Preface

### Step 1: Specify the main design challenge

**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**
> For this project, I centered my research around the accessibility to art venues in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area, specifically focusing on marginalized groups. This project will support users and citizens of Los Angeles in accessing/viewing art at public museums and venues free of charge, making art a communal and inclusive commodity.

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
> This activity fulfills the user's basic need for arts education, something that is not traditionally available to marginalized groups, but is vital to any user's understanding of Los Angeles' rich cultural history. Obtaining a comprehensive arts education allows for people to respect their city more and attain higher levels of happiness in said city. 

**What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
>Current solutions to satisfy this need for creating an inclusive arts culture in Los Angeles are sparse, but still exist. An example would be museums such as LACMA allowing free admission, which promotes the attendance of people from all avenues of Los Angeles, as well as smaller museums and art centers in Los Angeles hosting events and activity fairs to offer arts immersion to all peoples of LA. 

**What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
>Certain limitations for an arts education include: 1) Only getting information about arts education centers/venues through word-of-mouth, information that is not documentable or trackable, making it a highly unreliable source 2) Only hosting information about arts education centers on each center's respective website – this makes the findability of other art centers highly difficult, there should be one (1) mastersite to host the entirety of these resources.

### Step 2: Identify target users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
>Demographic: adult citizens of Los Angeles, underrepresented minorities, marginalized groups, students, researchers

>Preferences: Users have the desire and mobility to get around the city, users are proactive about obtaining an arts education and will put in the time to acquire the resources that they need

>Expertise: Users do not need any particular level of expertise to use this platform/application

**In what context (where, why) would the users do that activity?**
>A user would mainly attempt to gather an arts education when they are trying to enrich themselves on Los Angeles culture. The reason for wanting to obtain an arts education is subjective, but potential motives could include: 1) Being an underrepresented minority and wanting to understand the historical significance of your culture throughout the development of Los Angeles 2) Being a student researcher and wanting to conduct anthropological studies of the city 3) Needing to view historically significant artworks displayed exclusively in LA out of personal interest or to fulfill student coursework. Typically, someone with an understanding of the necessity of an arts education would be 18 years and older, and would probably seek such resources from the perspective of a student. 

**What would the users do to complete that activity?**
>To complete this activity, users would conduct thorough research on artworks of choice, visit local museums and art centers, and speak with professionals around them (museum curators, historians, local artists, anthropologists, etc) to gather a holistic understanding of the humanities in a metropolitan city. While the users would have many available manners by which to gather this information, the primary one would be visiting art centers and experiencing works first-hand.

### Step 3: Pick observation method(s)

* I decided to use a hybrid of two methods to conduct my research: participatory observation and interview.
  * For participatory observation I observed how my participant gathered information about arts education centers online.
  * For the interview, I asked my participant some questions about her view on the accesibility of the arts in LA and her preffered methods (online, word-of-mouth, visiting art centers, etc) of seeking this arts education as a minority himself.
* Both of these observations were conducted in person in Westwood, Los Angeles, California. 
* I used a webcam to video record both the interview and participatory observation.

### Noteworthy insights from the interview:

**:one: How often the user hears about issues with art accessibility and its relation to taking action (3:56)**
> "That’s like a big thing – I always hear about that [art education/accessibility], even in like middle school, high school – I always heard about that. It’s super big to give an arts education; my middle school was an arts magnet, so that was something that was always brought up. Especially with music, we were always told we were super lucky to have that."

**:two: How the user compares the experience of visiting small vs. large museums (6:57)**
> "I think large art museums help you, like, get your step into art – it’s not as intimidating, cause with small art museums there may be a more concentrated crowd, so you might feel like you don’t understand certain things, so I think the benefit in small art is like, there’s more nuances maybe and stuff like that, especially for people who are really interested in art, but then, in a large museum, it’s like taking that first step."

**:three: How the user weighs the importance of an arts education in LA versus other social issues (7:20)**
> "I think the arts are super important, before I say anything – it’s like one of the most important things to have in a well-rounded education; in LA, there’s a lot of problems going on, so I don’t know how much I feel that it should be important on the undergrad/grad level – I think it should be really important in the middle school/high school level, because from there students can take it wherever they want. But I think it should be important at that level, but there’s like so many important things, issues that go on in LA, and so I think this would be best-prioritized at that time."

## Reflection

Conducting the contequal inquiry process from beginning to end was an insightful and rewarding process. For the first time, I truly had the ability to set aside any inhibitions & preconceived notions and listen to a user detail out their own set of experiences with a particular topic/platform. Unlike the usability test in assigment #2, during which I conducted a remote interview and adhered to more structure, the in-person contextual inquiry that I carried out felt like a genuine conversation, in which every sentiment was absorbed and allowed me to further empathize with the user as we walked through a step-by-step process together. My participant was candid and transparent with his answers, which was truly integral to gathering the most authentic answers to better support my research. Additionally, it was reassuring to understand the user's suggestions and critiques of the product/platform, many musings of which had occured to me prior, further validating my personal research process. Although I'm sure there was room for error throughout this process and that every step was not not carried out perfectly, I had the opportunity to directly empathize with a user and their unique experiences with arts education opportunities and and centers in Los Angeles, a study that has shapped my research skills for the better.
