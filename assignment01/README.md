# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation - Anika Murthy, DH 110
## Feed the Planet
Growing up a vegetarian, I've always felt an undeniable connection to my surrounding environments. I believe in nourishing our surroundings and fostering environmental consciousness – our planet is our home and for the myriad of roles it serves us, it deserves our utmost respect and care. With time, I've grown to understand the importance of acts we can partake in to prevent the deterioration of our respective environments, especially those pertaining to public health and conscious acts of environmental service. 

To fuel my desire of preserving our planet by taking small steps like pioneering change in our immediate communities, I've chosen to center this project around the Arizonian government's various environmentally-related facets. Through the development of this project and its foundational research, I want to contribute to the creation of a delightful website that contains all of Arizona's environmental projects and initiatives, as well as houses an online community for locals to interact, collaborate, and further the preservation of their communities.  

To support this assignment, I have referenced two sources: [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://azdeq.gov/) and [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/). By utilizing these tools of analyses with a target audience of Arizonian adults in mind, I have carried out a comprehensive heuristic evaluation of Arizona's [Department of Environmental Quality](https://azdeq.gov/) and [Department of Health Services](https://www.azdhs.gov/index.php), both of which detail issues of public and enviromental health within the state. 

#### Scale
This rating scale will be utilized throughout the following heuristic evaluations in order to assess the severity of usability issues. 
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | No usability problems |
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |

#### Preface
The ADEQ is Arizona's Department of Environmental Quality. This branch of the state "administers the state’s environmental laws and delegated federal programs to prevent air, water and land pollution and ensure cleanup" (ADEQ). Their website is sorted by three environmental programs: Air Quality, Water Quality and Waste, with functional units responsible for technical, operational and policy support. A typical user of this site might be a citizen of Arizona seeking environmental resources to strive for change, information regarding the state's environmental history, or hearings within the community. 

#### Heuristic Evaluation
_Overall_: This website is strong in its application of aesthetic and minimalist design. The standard UI displays information in a relatively clear manner, making it easily navigatable to a variety of users, especially the target audience of Arizonian citizens. However, it could use strong improvement in its help & documentation, as well as error prevention, both of which factors restrict the user journey and experience.

| **7\. Flexibility and efficiency of use**<br>The website is tailored to the user and inclusive of varying levels of expertise.                                                     | **Good**: The website follows a standard UI – "Learn More" buttons are consistently employed across the site and there are no hidden pieces of information.<br>**Bad**: The website is not customizable to the user's needs and nor are there any usable shortcuts, making it less inclusive to the expert user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Allow for customizable functionalities and keyboard shotcuts to provide expert users with an efficient experience.                                                                                                                                      | 1                         |
| **8\. Aesthetic and minimalist design**<br>The website is only comprised of relevant information and is built to highlight these units.                                   | **Good**: The website contains a comprehensive sidebar with "Frequently Viewed" sub-pages/links, making it easy to access common resources and highlighting the site's most relevant units of information.

#### Preface
The AZDHS is Arizona's Department of Health Services. The branch itself spans a variety of public health-related disciplines, including, but not limited to: COVID-19, Health Screenings, Immunizations, etc. As stated by the AZDHS, their mission is to "promote, protect, and improve the health and wellness of individuals and communities in Arizona." The site includes information that is relevant to a myriad of groups such as: women, men, children & teens, seniors, clinicians, school representatives, Spanish speakers, and veterans, making the target audience a mélange of Arizonian citizens who may want to access health-related resources.

#### Heuristic Evaluation
_Overall_: This website is well-tailored for an Arizonian citizen to access health-related resources – the UI is clean and minimal and the information is displayed in an easily navigable manner. Although the site is a little bit on the denser side in regards to the amount of resources it holds, it is well-organized and its adherance to the visibility of system status makes the user journey more seamless. The site's shortcomings lie in its recognition, diagnosis, and recovery of/from errors, in which it could use some help in redirecting users and efficient problem-solving.

| **6\. Recognition rather than recall**<br>The website displays information that is vital to navigation in an accessible manner.                                        | **Good**: Each page on the site contains a distinct header, making it clear to the user exactly where they are and what information they can access at this point of their journey.<br>**Bad**: There are many ways to get to a specific position, making it difficult for a user to go back or understand how they got to a certain point of their journey. | Display small heading text explaining to the user the specific clicks and manner of navigation that brought them to their current position. | 2                         |
