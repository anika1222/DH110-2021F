# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation - Anika Murthy, DH 110
## Feed the Planet
Growing up a vegetarian, I've always felt an undeniable connection to my surrounding environments. I believe in nourishing our surroundings and fostering environmental consciousness â€“ our planet is our home and for the myriad of roles it serves us, it deserves our utmost respect and care. With time, I've grown to understand the importance of acts we can partake in to prevent the deterioration of our respective environments, especially those pertaining to public health and conscious acts of environmental service. 

To fuel my desire of preserving our planet by taking small steps like pioneering change in our immediate communities, I've chosen to center this project around the Arizonian government's various environmentally-related facets. Through the development of this project and its foundational research, I want to contribute to the creation of a delightful website that contains all of Arizona's environmental projects and initiatives, as well as houses an online community for locals to interact, collaborate, and further the preservation of their communities.  

To support this assignment, I have referenced two sources: [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://azdeq.gov/) and [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/). By utilizing these tools of analyses with a target audience of Arizonian adults in mind, I have carried out a comprehensive heuristic evaluation of Arizona's [Department of Environmental Quality](https://azdeq.gov/) and [Department of Health Services](https://www.azdhs.gov/index.php), both of which detail issues of public and enviromental health within the state.

#### Scale
The following rating scale can be used to evaluate the severity of usability issues:
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |

#### Heuristic Evaluation
Explain overall evaluation here.

Match between system and the real world**<br>The website uses language that is familiar to the user and presents information in a way that is analogous to the real world | **Good**: The site uses terms analagous to books like "Title", "Dedication", and "Chapters" to let users know exactly what they are editing.<br>**Bad**: The menu option "Pearls" is not familiar language or intuitive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Change the menu option titled "Pearls" to it's full name, "Pearls of Wisdom". Maybe change the name to "Words of Wisdom".                                                                                           | 1                         |

| **5\. Error prevention**<br>The website prevents errors by reducing error-prone conditions or checking for them and notifying the user                                          | Bad: The text input box for storytelling does not have spelling and grammar check options.<br>**Bad**: On the storytelling page, the site lets me navigate to a new page without saving my work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Have a pop-up message appear to let the user know that they have not saved their work before navigating to a new page.                                                                                              | 3                         |

Some users may think that "Preview Book" will lead them to the chapters page but this leads to a PDF of what is written so far, not the chapter editing page.<br>**Bad**: Within each chapter, each section has specific questions for the user to answer but there is no preview of the questions on the chapter page. They show up as "Section 1", "Section 2", etc. | Reduce the number of clicks needed to get to the chapter preview and eliminate confusing alternatives because it is the main page for editing the book.<br>Add a preview of the questions below each section title. | 3                         |
| **7\. Flexibility and efficiency of use**<br>The website allows processes to be tailored to all users from novice to expert                                                     | **Good**: The text editing box has buttons and allows shortcuts for modifying text (can use the "B" button or "ctrl+B" shortcut to make text bold).<br>**Bad**: There are limited options for entering story information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Add other ways for stories to be submitted, like with a text-to-voice option.                                                                                                                                       | 1                         |
| **8\. Aesthetic and minimalist design**<br>The website only contains information that is relevant and is designed to highlight the essentials                                   | **Good**: Most of the information on the website is essential to the book writing process or addresses user concerns about the product (Example Book).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | No recommendations for improvement.                                                                                                                                                                                 | 0                         |
| **9\. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**<br>The website provides clear error messages that state the problem and potential solutions                     | **Good**: If the user provides incorrect sign in information, the site tells the user that they have "Invalid Email or password"<br>**Bad**: The site does not specify which input is invalid and leaves the email address provided filled in, even if it is incorrect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Let the user know if the email isn't recognized or if the password is incorrect, and provide users with ways to resolve both errors.                                                                                | 2                         |

Provide a link to it on the "Contact" page so users can look at it before submitting a question that may have already been answered.                          | 3                         |
