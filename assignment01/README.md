# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation - Anika Murthy, DH 110
## Feed the Planet
Growing up a vegetarian, I've always felt an undeniable connection to my surrounding environments. I believe in nourishing our surroundings and fostering environmental consciousness – our planet is our home and for the myriad of roles it serves us, it deserves our utmost respect and care. With time, I've grown to understand the importance of acts we can partake in to prevent the deterioration of our respective environments, especially those pertaining to public health and conscious acts of environmental service. 

To fuel my desire of preserving our planet by taking small steps like pioneering change in our immediate communities, I've chosen to center this project around the Arizonian government's various environmentally-related facets. Through the development of this project and its foundational research, I want to contribute to the creation of a delightful website that contains all of Arizona's environmental projects and initiatives, as well as houses an online community for locals to interact, collaborate, and further the preservation of their communities.  

To support this assignment, I have referenced two sources: [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://azdeq.gov/) and [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/). By utilizing these tools of analyses with a target audience of Arizonian adults in mind, I have carried out a comprehensive heuristic evaluation of Arizona's [Department of Environmental Quality](https://azdeq.gov/) and [Department of Health Services](https://www.azdhs.gov/index.php), both of which detail issues of public and enviromental health within the state.

#### Preface
The ADEQ is Arizona's Department of Environmental Quality. This branch of the state "administers the state’s environmental laws and delegated federal programs to prevent air, water and land pollution and ensure cleanup" (ADEQ). Their website is sorted by three environmental programs: Air Quality, Water Quality and Waste, with functional units responsible for technical, operational and policy support. A typical user of this site might be a citizen of Arizona seeking environmental resources to strive for change, information regarding the state's environmental history, or hearings within the community. 

#### Scale
This rating scale will be utilized throughout the following heuristic evaluations in order to assess the severity of usability issues. 
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |

| **5\. Error prevention**<br>The website eliminates error-prone conditions and mitigates potential erros through the employment of confirmation actions.                                          | Bad: The text input box for storytelling does not have spelling and grammar check options.<br>**Bad**: On the storytelling page, the site lets me navigate to a new page without saving my work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Have a pop-up message appear to let the user know that they have not saved their work before navigating to a new page.                                                                                              | 3                         |

Some users may think that "Preview Book" will lead them to the chapters page but this leads to a PDF of what is written so far, not the chapter editing page.<br>**Bad**: Within each chapter, each section has specific questions for the user to answer but there is no preview of the questions on the chapter page. They show up as "Section 1", "Section 2", etc. | Reduce the number of clicks needed to get to the chapter preview and eliminate confusing alternatives because it is the main page for editing the book.<br>Add a preview of the questions below each section title. | 3                         |
| **7\. Flexibility and efficiency of use**<br>The website is tailored to the user and inclusive of varying levels of expertise.                                                     | **Good**: The text editing box has buttons and allows shortcuts for modifying text (can use the "B" button or "ctrl+B" shortcut to make text bold).<br>**Bad**: There are limited options for entering story information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Add other ways for stories to be submitted, like with a text-to-voice option.                                                                                                                                       | 1                         |
| **8\. Aesthetic and minimalist design**<br>The website is only comprised of relevant information and is built to highlight these units.                                   | **Good**: Most of the information on the website is essential to the book writing process or addresses user concerns about the product (Example Book).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | No recommendations for improvement.                                                                                                                                                                                 | 0                         |
| **9\. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**<br>The website presents clear error messages that indicate and solve any potential problems.                   | **Good**: If the user provides incorrect sign in information, the site tells the user that they have "Invalid Email or password"<br>**Bad**: The site does not specify which input is invalid and leaves the email address provided filled in, even if it is incorrect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Let the user know if the email isn't recognized or if the password is incorrect, and provide users with ways to resolve both errors.                                                                                | 2                         |

| **2\. Match between system and the real world**<br>The website presents information in a logical order in a language that is familiar to the user and adheres to real-world conventions. | **Good**: The site uses terms analagous to books like "Title", "Dedication", and "Chapters" to let users know exactly what they are editing.<br>**Bad**: The menu option "Pearls" is not familiar language or intuitive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Change the menu option titled "Pearls" to it's full name, "Pearls of Wisdom".

| **3\. User control and freedom**<br>The website allows for users to undo unwanted actions with ease.                                                                           | **Good**: The text input box for stories allows the user to undo an action by using the "ctrl+z" keys.<br>**Bad**: The site doesn't let the user change answers to the life questions or remove chapters from the book.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Allow users to change answers to the life questions or remove chapters from the book.

| **5\. Error prevention**<br>The website eliminates error-prone conditions and mitigates potential erros through the employment of confirmation actions.                                          | Bad: The text input box for storytelling does not have spelling and grammar check options.<br>**Bad**: On the storytelling page, the site lets me navigate to a new page without saving my work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Have a pop-up message appear to let the user know that they have not saved their work before navigating to a new page.                                                                                              | 3                         |
| **6\. Recognition rather than recall**<br>The website displays information that is vital to navigation in an accessible manner.                                        | **Good**: Hovering over a button in the text editing box provides a description of the action and tells the user what keys serve as a shortcut for the action.<br>**Bad**: To see the chapters, the user has to go to "Book Overview" then "Save Content". Some users may think that "Preview Book" will lead them to the chapters page but this leads to a PDF of what is written so far, not the chapter editing page.<br>**Bad**: Within each chapter, each section has specific questions for the user to answer but there is no preview of the questions on the chapter page. They show up as "Section 1", "Section 2", etc. | Reduce the number of clicks needed to get to the chapter preview and eliminate confusing alternatives because it is the main page for editing the book.<br>Add a preview of the questions below each section title. | 3                         |
| **7\. Flexibility and efficiency of use**<br>The website is tailored to the user and inclusive of varying levels of expertise.                                                     | **Good**: The text editing box has buttons and allows shortcuts for modifying text (can use the "B" button or "ctrl+B" shortcut to make text bold).<br>**Bad**: There are limited options for entering story information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Add other ways for stories to be submitted, like with a text-to-voice option.                                                                                                                                       | 1                         |
| **8\. Aesthetic and minimalist design**<br>The website is only comprised of relevant information and is built to highlight these units.                                   | **Good**: Most of the information on the website is essential to the book writing process or addresses user concerns about the product (Example Book).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | No recommendations for improvement.                                                                                                                                                                                 | 0                         |
| **9\. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**<br>The website presents clear error messages that indicate and solve any potential problems.                   | **Good**: If the user provides incorrect sign in information, the site tells the user that they have "Invalid Email or password"<br>**Bad**: The site does not specify which input is invalid and leaves the email address provided filled in, even if it is incorrect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Let the user know if the email isn't recognized or if the password is incorrect, and provide users with ways to resolve both errors.                                                                                | 2                         |
